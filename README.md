# mashHF
This repository implements the analyses for the Princeton undergraduate thesis of Kiran Biddinger.

Single-trait exome-wide association analyses are implemented in the REGENIE folder.

Helper scripts, such as scripts to construct the data files and to perform mash multi-trait testing, are contained within the R folder.
